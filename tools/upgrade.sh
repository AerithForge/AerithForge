# Replace all instances of "x-hacks" with more reliable alternatives.
# The "x-hacks" were used in the past to ensure compatibility across different shells and systems,
# but they have become obsolete. We are replacing them with more reliable code.
# This change is based on the previous pull request (#5713) that discusses the need for these changes.

  # Replace "x$var" == "xval" with "[[ $var == val ]]"
