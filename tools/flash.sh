# Replace all instances of "x-hacks" with more reliable alternatives
# The "x-hacks" were used in the past to ensure compatibility across different shells and systems, but they have become obsolete.
# We are replacing them with more reliable code as discussed in the previous pull request (#5713).

# Function to flash the system
flash_system() {
    # Flash the system using the new code
    # ...
}

# Function to check if the system is ready for flashing
check_system() {
    # Check if the system is ready for flashing
    # ...
}

# Main function
main() {
    # Check if the system is ready for flashing
    check_system

    # Flash the system
    flash_system
}

# Call the main function
