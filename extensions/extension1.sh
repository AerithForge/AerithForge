# This script has been modified to remove the 'x-hack' and replace it with a more reliable alternative.

# Original conditional statement: [ "x$var" = "xval" ]
# Modified conditional statement: [ "$var" = "val" ]

# The 'x-hack' was used to ensure compatibility across different shells and systems, but it is now considered obsolete due to the evolution of shell scripting languages.

# The modified conditional statement is more reliable and adheres to modern shell scripting best practices.

# Start of script

var="val"

if [[ ${var} == "val" ]]; then
	echo "The variable is equal to the value."
else
	echo "The variable is not equal to the value."
fi

# End of script
