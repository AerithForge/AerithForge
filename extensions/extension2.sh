# This script has been modified to remove the 'x-hack' and replace it with a more reliable alternative.

# Original code:
# if [ "x$var" = "xval" ]; then
#     echo "Variable is equal to value"
# fi

# Modified code:
if [[ ${var} == "val" ]]; then
	echo "Variable is equal to value"
fi

# The 'x-hack' was an old shell scripting practice used to ensure compatibility across different shells and systems.
# It is now considered obsolete due to the evolution of shell scripting languages.
# The 'x-hack' has been replaced with a more reliable alternative in this script.
